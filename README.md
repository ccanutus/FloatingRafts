This repository includes raw data related to Garcia-Walther et al. 2023 published in Ecology. 

# Table S1. Summary of bird surveys using rafts #
Data used to obtain this summary is found in file “S1. Summary of birds using rafts.xls”. These files will show fours spread sheets with the following fields:
  1.	Metrics: A table that summarizes raw data with the following fields. 
      •	Point: the name of the point count
      •	Date: the date of the survey
      •	Feeding:  a bird was categorized as feeding when it was observed feeding over the raft
      •	Roosting: a bird was categorized as roosting when it was observed roosting over the raft
      •	Total: the total number of birds when summing “feeding” plus “roosting” columns
      •	RaftAreaM2: Approximate size of the raft area in square meters.
      •	Tide: the tide measurement in centimeters during the survey. 
      2.	Low tides: Raw data during surveys categorized as low tide (tidal height < 90 cm) with the following fields: 
      •	Species: the bird species being absent or otherwise counted.
      •	Code: four letter species code
      •	Count (Feeding): a count of the number of birds of a species showing feeding behavior.
      •	Count (roosting): a count of the number of birds of a species showing roosting behavior.
      •	Count (Flying): a count of the number of birds of a species showing flying behavior
      •	Count (Total): the sum of the birds of a given species showing a flying, roosting or feeding behavior.
      •	Start Time: start time of the survey
      •	End time: end time of the survey
      •	Date: date of the survey
      •	Transect: rransect number containing a set of point counts
      •	Point: point counts at a specific habitat within a given transect. 
      •	Recorder: rhe person who recorded the survey
      •	Tide: the tide measurement at the time of the survey
  3.	Medium Tides: Raw data during surveys categorized as medium tide (tidal height = 90 – 175 cm). The fields included are the same as the previous spreadsheet.
  4.	High Tides: Raw data during surveys categorized as high tide (tidal height > 175 cm). The fields included are the same as the previous spreadsheet.

# Table S2. Habitat metric comparison of birds using Las Cruces Wetland #
Data used to obtain this table is found in file “S2. Habitat metric comparison of birds using Las Cruces Wetland.xls”. These files will show seven spread sheets:
    •	Habitat Metrics: a table that summarizes raw data comparing raft, intertidal plain, intertidal bar and marsh habitat.
    •	Richness and metric summary: a summary of habitat metrics and richness of species per surveyed habitat
    •	04-nov-2022, 10-nov-2022, 15-nov-2022, 25-nov-2022, 06-dic-2022: five spreadsheet of raw data for the surveyed dates closest to the dates when rafts where surveyed. 

# Figure 1d. #
File “topographic profile” shows a spreadsheet with the following fields:
    •	Area: area at which the profile was measured
    •	Profile: the code name for the topographic profile
    •	X: x coordinates in UTM
    •	Y: y coordinates in UTM
    •	Dist: distance from the beginning of the profile
    •	Height: vertical coordinates in meters

# Figure 2a. #
This folder includes GPS tracks for one red knot during four consecutive days of neap tides (15-18 December 2022) and 1 day of spring tides (21 December 2022). Files are in shapefile format. 

# Figure 2b. #
This folder includes one spreadsheet with the following fields:
    •	Time: the time at 30 min. intervals during 21 December
    •	Tide: the tide measurement every 30 min. in centimeters. 
    •	Position: Based on a red knot’s activity recorded by a GPS biologger on 21 December, each numbered position signifies its consecutive movement until 16:30.
    •	Activity: the most likely behavior based on accelerometer data, tide measurement and gps altimeter. 
    Figure 3b. This folder includes one spreadsheet with the following fields:
    •	Time: the time of the day in 5 minutes intervals on 21 December 2022
    •	Depth: The estimated water depth by a waterlogger at a given time of the day
    •	Position: The position of one red knots in relation to its tracks in Fig. 2a
